# VCP-clean-code-rules
Practical clean code reminders with tiny C# before/after snippets.

## How to use
- Browse the topic folders under `CleanCode/`.
- Each `.cs` file states a rule, shows a BAD example, and suggests a BETTER approach.
- Use them as quick refreshers, onboarding material, or discussion starters in code reviews.

## Folder map
- `CleanCode/CASE1-NAMING`: intent-revealing names, avoiding misleading or noisy context.
- `CleanCode/CASE2-VARIABLES`: scope, clarity, magic values, and meaningful identifiers.
- `CleanCode/CASE3-CODING`: branching, method responsibilities, separators, and dead code.
- `CleanCode/CASE4_CODINGSTYLE`: access modifiers, field discipline, and immutability.
- `CleanCode/CASE5_EXCEPTIONS`: throwing, rethrowing, and controlling flow with exceptions.
- `CleanCode/CASE6-TESTING`: test naming, isolation, and single-behavior focus.

Use or adapt the snippets in training decks, brown-bag sessions, or as prompts for practicing refactors.
